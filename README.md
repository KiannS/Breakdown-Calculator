# Breakdown-Calculator
Retainer/Waterfall Breakdown Calculator for Seattle Software Developers

Name: Breakdown Calculator

Built Using: Google Sheets and modern JavaScript

Purpose:

The Breakdown Calculator is designed to assist Seattle Software Developers (SSD) in calculating project-related financial data, specifically term prices, revenues, and costs for different time periods within the projects they are working on.

Functionality:

The Breakdown Calculator comprises three main sheets: Waterfall, Retainer, and Estimate Doc. Each sheet serves a distinct purpose in calculating and documenting project financials.

Waterfall Calculator:

Inputs:

Number of months for the project
Service type
Cost
Price
Additional information (if applicable)
Outputs:

Monthly profit
Profit margin
Recommended markup amount
Payment breakdown for the client
Payment breakdown for developers (dev)
Payment breakdown for SSD
Description: The Waterfall Calculator takes user-provided information regarding project specifics, such as duration, service type, cost, and price. It then performs the following calculations:

Calculates the monthly profit.
Determines the profit margin as a percentage.
Recommends a markup amount.
Breaks down payments for the client, developers, and SSD.
Retainer Calculator:

Inputs:

Number of months for the retainer
Service type
Cost
Price
Additional information (if applicable)
Outputs:

Monthly profit
Profit margin
Recommended markup amount
Payment breakdown for the client
Payment breakdown for developers (dev)
Payment breakdown for SSD
Description: The Retainer Calculator operates similarly to the Waterfall Calculator but is designed for projects with indefinite durations, such as retainers. It calculates the same metrics, including monthly profit, profit margin, recommended markup, and payment breakdowns for different parties involved.

Estimate Doc Calculator:

Inputs:

Cost per month
Outputs:

Running total for each month
Description: The Estimate Doc Calculator serves a different purpose compared to the previous two sheets. It takes a single input, the cost per month, and calculates a running total for each subsequent month. This running total is useful for conveniently incorporating financial details into contracts, providing a clear picture of cumulative costs over time.

Usage:

Users can input project-specific details into the appropriate calculator sheet, and the Breakdown Calculator will automatically perform the necessary calculations and provide the relevant financial breakdowns.

This tool is particularly valuable for SSD when it comes to pricing projects, managing retainers, and preparing estimates for contracts.

Note:

This Breakdown Calculator tool can be customized and expanded upon as needed to accommodate any specific requirements or changes in SSD's financial processes. Additionally, users should ensure data accuracy and review calculated results for validity.
